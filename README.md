# MM-Lab
For CS 429 Computer Organization and Architecture taught at UT Austin by Dr. Chatterjee

In this lab, I wrote a dynamic storage allocator for C programs, i.e., my own version of the malloc and free routines.
I was encouraged to explore the design space creatively and implement an allocator that is correct, efficient, and fast.
This repository is not public for the purposes of cheating, so no students should refer to my code for assistance.
