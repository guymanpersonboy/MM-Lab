FIll out this document with the intended design. This design is not final, and can
be updated if you run into problems completing the project

How will the heap be structured?
 - A best fit placement
 - double each csbrk call

How will umalloc be implemented?
 - Splitting

How will ufree be implemented?
 - Immediate coalescing

What checks are putting into check_heap?
1. check if every block in the free list is marked as free?
2. Is every free block on the free list?
6. Do any allocated blocks overlap with each other?
7. Do any allocated blocks overlap with a free block?
TODO check 9.

Are you making any changes to the memory_block_t struct?
 - Not sure yet

Once this project is finsihed, these answers will finalized in the write up.
